## üéØ Key Findings

### Hotelling's Law Evidence: **STRONG** ‚úÖ

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Hotels in Clusters** | 132 out of 141 (93.6%) | Extremely high clustering tendency |
| **Average Competitors per Hotel** | 6.33 within 2km | High spatial competition |
| **Competition Clusters Identified** | 21 distinct clusters | Multiple competition zones |
| **Average Distance to Competitors** | 0.98 km | Very close proximity |
| **Isolated Hotels** | 9 (6.4%) | Minimal spatial dispersion |

## üìä Competition Analysis Results

### Competition Intensity Distribution
- **High Competition Areas** (5+ competitors): **93 hotels** (66%)
- **Medium Competition Areas** (2-4 competitors): **28 hotels** (20%)
- **Low Competition Areas** (1 competitor): **11 hotels** (8%)
- **No Competition** (isolated): **9 hotels** (6%)

### Geographic Clustering Patterns
- **92.2% of hotels** are located in proximity clusters
- **21 competition clusters** identified across Corfu
- Largest cluster: **26 hotels** in central Corfu area
- Smallest clusters: **2 hotels** in peripheral locations

## üó∫Ô∏è Spatial Competition Hotspots

### Top Competition Zones:
1. **Central Corfu Coast** - 26 hotels clustered
2. **Corfu Town Area** - 26 hotels clustered  
3. **Messonghi/Moraitika** - 10 hotels clustered
4. **Sidari Region** - 9 hotels clustered
5. **Roda/Acharavi** - 6 hotels clustered each

### Competition Hotspot Examples:
- **Spiti Nikos Apartments** - 9 competitors within 2km
- **Siora Vittoria Boutique Hotel** - 8 competitors within 2km

## üìà Statistical Evidence

### Distance Analysis:
- **Shortest distance between hotels**: 0.019 km (19 meters!)
- **Average distance between all hotels**: 18.07 km
- **Average distance to nearest competitors**: 0.98 km

### Star Rating Competition:
- **3-star hotels** show highest similar-rating competition (2.33 avg)
- **4-star hotels** moderate competition (1.04 avg)
- Evidence of quality-based clustering within spatial clusters

## üéØ Hotelling's Law Conclusions

### Why This Supports Hotelling's Law:

1. **Spatial Agglomeration**: 93.6% clustering rate demonstrates strong tendency to locate near competitors

2. **Competition Zones**: 21 distinct clusters show businesses concentrate in specific areas rather than spreading evenly

3. **Proximity Competition**: Average 0.98km to competitors indicates direct spatial competition

4. **Market Access**: Hotels cluster near popular beaches, towns, and attractions (shared market access)

5. **Consumer Convenience**: Clustered locations make comparison shopping easier for tourists

### Economic Implications:

- **Tourist Convenience**: Clustered hotels allow easy comparison and selection
- **Infrastructure Sharing**: Shared access to transportation, attractions, and services
- **Competition Benefits**: Price competition and service quality improvements
- **Market Efficiency**: Optimal resource allocation through spatial competition
