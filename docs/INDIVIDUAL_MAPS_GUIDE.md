# Individual Hotelling's Law Analysis Maps üó∫Ô∏è

## 4 Clear, Separate Maps for Presentation

Each map shows a different aspect of **Hotelling's Law** analysis for Corfu hotels. All maps use real Corfu geographic boundaries and show the same 141 hotels with different analytical perspectives.

## üìä **Map 1: Competition Intensity**
**File:** `map1_competition_intensity.png`

### What it shows:
- **Red heat map** showing competition intensity
- **Larger circles** = more competitors nearby
- **Darker red** = higher competition
- **Statistics box** with key numbers

### Key insights:
- Hotels with 5+ competitors (high competition areas)
- Average 6.3 competitors per hotel within 2km
- Clear competition hotspots in tourist areas

---

## üåç **Map 2: Geographic Clustering**  
**File:** `map2_clustering_analysis.png`

### What it shows:
- **Different colors** for different hotel clusters
- **21 distinct clusters** identified
- **Black X marks** = isolated hotels
- **Color legend** showing cluster sizes

### Key insights:
- 93.6% of hotels are in clusters (not isolated)
- Largest cluster has 26 hotels
- Strong evidence of spatial competition

---

## ‚≠ê **Map 3: Star Rating Competition**
**File:** `map3_rating_competition.png`

### What it shows:
- **Cool/warm colors** showing similar-rating competition
- **Larger circles** = more similar-rating competitors
- **Blue/red scale** for competition intensity
- **Statistics box** with rating breakdowns

### Key insights:
- 3-star hotels have highest similar-rating competition
- Quality-based clustering within geographic clusters
- Rating competition patterns

---

## üìè **Map 4: Distance to Competitors**
**File:** `map4_distance_analysis.png`

### What it shows:
- **Green/yellow colors** showing average distance to competitors
- **Green** = very close to competitors
- **Yellow** = further from competitors
- **Distance statistics** in info box

### Key insights:
- Average 0.98km to nearest competitors
- Some hotels only 19 meters apart!
- Clear proximity competition patterns

## üéØ **How to Use These Maps**

### **For Presentations:**
1. **Start with Map 2** - shows overall clustering pattern
2. **Show Map 1** - demonstrates competition intensity
3. **Use Map 3** - for quality/rating analysis
4. **End with Map 4** - shows proximity patterns

### **For Analysis:**
- **Map 1** ‚Üí Competition hotspots identification
- **Map 2** ‚Üí Market segmentation and zones
- **Map 3** ‚Üí Quality positioning analysis  
- **Map 4** ‚Üí Spatial competition measurement

### **Key Statistics to Mention:**
- **93.6% clustering rate** - strong Hotelling's Law evidence
- **21 competition clusters** - multiple market zones
- **6.3 average competitors** - high spatial competition
- **0.98km average distance** - very close proximity

## üìã **Technical Details**

- **Resolution:** 300 DPI (high quality for printing)
- **Size:** 16x12 inches (clear for presentations)
- **Format:** PNG with white background
- **Data:** 141 hotels with valid coordinates
- **Method:** DBSCAN clustering, Haversine distances
- **Map Base:** Real OpenStreetMap Corfu boundaries

Each map is optimized for clarity and can be used individually in presentations, reports, or publications to demonstrate different aspects of Hotelling's Law in the Corfu hotel market.
